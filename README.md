# Virtualization
I undertook a project to deepen my understanding of cloud infrastructure, focusing on virtualization and private networks. I transformed my laptop into a cloud environment by creating two virtual machines (VMs) using VirtualBox, both running CentOS. This allowed me to simulate separate server environments on a single physical device, a key concept in cloud computing.

One of the virtual machines was configured as a web server using Apache, while the other served as a database server. I set up NAT (Network Address Translation) for private IP communication between the VMs, ensuring secure data transfer while isolating the database server from external access. The website deployed on the web server was accessible only within the private network, demonstrating the principles of local hosting and network segmentation.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in configuring network settings, managing resources like CPU and storage for virtualized environments, and implementing basic security measures. Additionally, I worked with tools like SSH and FTP for remote access and file transfer. This hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of cloud computing, particularly in how virtual machines operate, how private networks can be secured, and how web services can be deployed in a cloud-like environment.
